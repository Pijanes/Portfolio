# Portfolio
Here you can find various projects from Datamining to AI Architecture

Visual_Data_Analysis:

Here you can find some Datamining/Datavisuals realized with pandas/matlplotlib/seaborn with real-world-data from the Gapminder Project.
As a result you can check out the animated_gif_gapminder, that shows the dynamic of fertility/life expectancy over time!

Classification:

Here you can find some ML with a Dataset from Titanic Passengers, including Logistic Regression/Decision Tree/Random Forest, 
realized with Scikit-Learn (also Hyper Parameter Optimiziation and Evaluation with confusion matrix/cross-validation/AUC/ROC).

As a result you can check out the graph of a Decisison Tree Classifier, that shows the probalitities of surviving/non-surviving 
the Titanic catastrophe according to features of passengers.
