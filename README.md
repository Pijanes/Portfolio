# Portfolio
Here you can find various projects from Datamining to AI Architecture

Visual_Data_Analysis:

Here you can find some Datamining/Datavisuals realized with pandas/matlplotlib/seaborn with real-world-data from the Gapminder Project.
As a result you can check out the animated_gif_gapminder, that shows the dynamic of fertility/life expectancy over time!

Classification:

Here you can find some ML with a Dataset from Titanic Passengers, including Logistic Regression/Decision Tree/Random Forest/SVM(SVC), 
realized with Scikit-Learn (also Hyper Parameter Optimiziation and Evaluation with confusion matrix/cross-validation/AUC/ROC).

As a result you can check out the graph of a Decisison Tree Classifier, that shows the probalitities of surviving/non-surviving 
the Titanic catastrophe according to features of passengers.

Regression:

Here you can find a business case with Data Exploration/Data Wrangling/Feature Engineering using time series in panda 
and ML using cross-validation for testing, Polynominal Features for training the model and Regularisation 
with Ridge/Lasso/ElasticNet for optimizing the model.
As a result you can check out a user interface for prediction, using the trained linear regression model.

Text Classification:

Webscraped song lyrics using requests/Regular Expressions/Scrapy/BeautifulSoup4 and visualized word frequency with a word cloud.
Prepared the text for machine learning by using Bag of Words method to vectorize the text.
Used a language processing toolkit (SpaCy) and trained a classification model to predict the artist from a piece of text.
Refactored the code into functions and wrote a command-line interface for the program.

Time Series Analysis:

Created a data frame with time stamps from real-world data (European Climate Assessment & Dataset), realized data wrangling and feature
engineering using pandas.
Realized time series decomposition into Trend, Seasonality and Baseline with noise.
Trained an Autoregressive Model to forecast temperatures, visualized the weather forcast results.
Calculated quality metrics (MSE,MAE) using cross-validation to improve generalizability of trained model.

Markov Simulation:

Generated a report for the sales department with statistical and visual insights into customer behaviour of a fictional supermarket in order to
optimize layout, staffing and service.
Used Object-Oriented-Programming to represent customers.
Used a Monte Carlo Markov Chain Simulation to simulate movement across sections by customers.

Recommender System:

Built up a SQL database with real-world data (MovieLens dataset). Used Principal Component Analysis to identify the most relevant features
that explain the bulk of the variance.
Trained a unsupervised learning model (Non-negative matrix factorization) to realize Collaborative Filtering.
Wrote a Flask web interface to deploy the model for movie recommendations based on users ratings.
